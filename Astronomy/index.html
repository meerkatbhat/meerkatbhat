		<p> On December 21 2020 many people where outside looking at two planets. On Monday Jupiter and Saturn came as close as a tenth of a degree apart in the 
		sky. The last time they where this close was in the early 1200's! To think we are living in the time where Juipter and Saturn came this close, and for the
		first time scientists(and the world) know what's really going on.
