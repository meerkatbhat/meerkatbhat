Finding the right author and genre is very importent if you want to enjoy reading.
This page will show you how to identify your favorite genre's and authors. Good Luck!

GENRE

1. Know what you find intresting.
If your that princcess type of girl maybe you'll enjoy
fantasy,on the other hand you might enjoy mystery.

2. Get recomendations from family and friends who are
intrested in the same thing. Teachers help to.

3. Dig deep. 
Reaserch those famous authors you thought
were boring.

4. Read the book, then watch the movive.
The only reason I sugest reading before watching
is that movies leave out some deatials or add things
in. Reading the original copy is much better.
