<p>Finding the right author and genre is very importent if you want to enjoy reading.
This page will show you how to identify your favorite genre's and authors. Good Luck!<p>

<h1> <strong>Finding the Genre</strong> </h1>
<ol>
  <li>Know what you find intresting.                      <img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2019/03/02/2019_03_02_66706_1551461528._large.jpg" alt="pile of books"
If your that princcess type of girl maybe you'll enjoy
fantasy,on the other hand you might enjoy mystery.
  <li>Get recomendations from family and friends who are
intrested in the same thing. Teachers help to.
  <li>Dig deep. 
Reaserch those <em>famous authors<em> you thought
were boring.
  <li>4. Read the book, then watch the movive.
The only reason I sugest reading before watching
is that movies leave out some deatials or add things
in. Reading the original copy is much better.
