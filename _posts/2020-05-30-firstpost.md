<h2> Mindset Chapter 1 <h2>
 <h4> <p>At the beignning of chapter 1 the author, Carol S. Dweck
   says that first step to having a growth mindset is 
   learning to cope with falure, positively. To give you an example
   Carol explains that the frenchman who created the IQ test hadn't
   created it to mesure your smart, but to help kids who were struggling 
   in school. He belived that education and practice. This proves that
   your traits and features aren't set in stone. 
   The Mindsets are described below
   <ul>
    <li> <strong>Fixed,</strong> 'I'm a reject and loser.'
    <li> <strong>Growth,</strong> 'I need to try harder to be better, and understand how other 
     people are feeling.'
    <li> <strong>Growth,</strong> 'I won't know if I can 'till I do!'
    <li> <strong>Growth,</strong> turn failing into a learning experince
   </ul>
   Many people of both mindsets read books like "7 secrets to success" but
   what most people don't relize is that, do these books ever tell you how or
   why to use these tips! When the mindsets are understood you'll get a 
   better grasp of the tips, ripple effect, and how to switch your mindset.<h4> <p>
